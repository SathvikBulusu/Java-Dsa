oop means object oriented progamming and it is used to create objects that contain both data and methods

oop is faster and easy to execute
oop provides a clear structure for the programs
oop uses Dry principle (DONT repeat Yourself)


there are 4 principles

1. inheritance :- so it can be used to create classes from an existing classes

2. polymorphism :- the ability to write the progams in many different type sis called polymorhpism


it has compile time poly morphism :- method overloading and method overriding this is while compiling


method overloading -- same method name diff parameters

---> run time polymorphism :- binding of method call statement with method definition done at runtime

          same name and same method parameters
 and method overriding cannot be done in same class but can be performmed in different classes

----> super keyword :- parent class stuff being showcased and it is present as a first statement in every construct as default
