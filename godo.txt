there are four ways to access variables

when there is static variables we use this way to access variables

1. through class name
2. using directly

** when there is no static then use this **
3. through objects
4. through object references

There are types of storages that i need to know inorder to learn the java
  -- > 1. Method Area
       2. Stack Area
       3. Heap Area
       4. pc registers
       5. Native Stack

so the static is what is given a preference while running the code by jvm , the difference between

the local variable is the variable that is defined in a method and it doesn't have the judisdiction to have the same value in the
different area
